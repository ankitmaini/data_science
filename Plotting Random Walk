# Learning Random Walk
# Python 3.x

# Importing numpy as np and setting the seed to 202 to allow reproducibility
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(202)

# Initialize an empty list and setting the first step of the walk as 0, as any walk would start from beginning
random_walk = [0]

# Writing for loop for 100 steps of the walk
for x in range(100) :
    # Assigining the last element of random_walk list to step
    step = random_walk[-1]

    # dice is a random number storing variable - say a dice in practical life which generates a random number between 1 and 6 (both inclusive)
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    # Writing conditional to calculate the value of step based on the random number generated
    if dice <= 2:
        step = step - 1
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    # After the value of step is calculated from the conditional, it is appended to the list
    random_walk.append(step)

# Prints out the list random walk
print(random_walk)

# Plotting the random walk along a variable y
y = [i for i in range(101)] # 101 values are used as in the random_Walk array each element is added to the initialised list. So 101 elements exist in random_walk

# Importing pyplot from matplotlib as plt to permit plotting of graph
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting random_walk on X-axis and y on Y-Axis
plt.plot(random_walk, y)
plt.show()
